#	  Name: "<storage name>"    // (string) Storage name will be sent to the client to display on the title bar.
#	  Table: "<storage_table>"  // (string) Name of table where storage is saved. The table stucture is the same as the default storage table.
#	  Max: <max_amount>         // (int) *optional* Maximum number of items in storage. MAX_STORAGE will be used if no value is defined.
